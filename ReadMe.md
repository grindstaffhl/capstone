## Setup
#### MAMP
Go to the following url [here](https://www.mamp.info/en/) and download MAMP. MAMP Pro is not required for this project. Follow the prompts to install MAMP. Once MAMP is properly installed, open the application and click "Start Serviers". The Apache server and MySQL server will start to connect and run. The Apache Port is 80 and MySQL Port is 3306 by default. If you already have a different application running through those ports, you can change where apache and mysql runs through by clicking "Preferences->Ports". Likewise, you can view and change where the files for your web server will be saved on you computer by going to "Preferences->Web Server".

Once both the Apache and MySQL severs are up and running, you can select "Open start page". This will take you to your MAMP server home page. You can now download or clone the files in this repository to the directory where your MAMP web server points to on your computer. After the files have been downloaded, navigate back to your MAMP home page and select "My Website". This takes you to the directory of the files your web server points to on your computer. Clicking on each specific php file will display the contents in the database for that item. To view the database, navigate back to your MAMP home page and select "Tools->phpMyAdmin". This is where the database is located.
