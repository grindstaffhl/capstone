## Project Overview
1. ### Description 
In The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, players are able to create, enhance, and utilize weapons and armor for combat. The player’s character increases their skills, such as One-Handed, Light Armor, Blocking, etc., in order to level up. In doing so, a perk is available to the player, which adds a special effect in said skill tree in which the perk belongs. Although each perk is given a small description, there is no way to experience the effect of the perk until you take the time to level up and use a skill point to unlock said perk. Because of this, some players may feel like they wasted a skill point because the perk did not enhance their character in the way they expected. Our goal is to create a website for players to create and plan out their Skyrim character, with emphasis on how prospective perks affect numerical values for weapon damage and armor defense. The user will enter their character’s data, such as character level, skill level and perks achieved for relevant skill trees, and any active effects or any apparel that grants enhancements.The website will allow the user to plan a character build, see how much damage a weapon can do with specific perks or at a specific skill level, the effect certain potions will have upon crafting weapons or armor, which armor will provide the best protection, and understand what perks are ideal for the user’s character to have.
